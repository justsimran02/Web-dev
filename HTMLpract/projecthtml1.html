                        My journey has been an exciting fusion of hardware and software, as I've gained a solid foundation in electronics, circuits, 
                        and systems, while also nurturing a deep fascination for coding, algorithms, and software development. üåêüí°
                        What sets me apart is my hunger for learning and my knack for problem-solving. 
                        I've already honed my analytical thinking skills through tackling complex engineering challenges, 
                        and now I'm ready to seamlessly translate those skills into writing elegant code and building innovative software solutions. üíªüîå

                    <p>AUG 2023-SEPT 2023</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As an intern at HTC Global Services, I actively contributed to
                            an AI and Machine Learning project focused on predicting
                            customer churn. </li>
                        <li>
                        Through a systematic approach, I employed diverse data
                         processing and preprocessing techniques to enhance data
                         quality.

                <h3>Customer Churn Prediction</h3>
                <p>Machine Learning Model Development: My expertise in machine
                    learning shines as I have developed sophisticated predictive models using several algorithms. I have employed ensemble techniques, and optimized model architectures to ensure optimal performance. Churn Prediction Accuracy: The model boasts impressive accuracy
                    in predicting customer churn. By analyzing historical customer behavior and identifying patterns, the system can accurately
                    forecast which customers are likely to churn in the near future.</p>

                    <h3>Image filtering using crptography and stagnography</h3>
                    <p>Research Paper: Our achievements are documented in a research
                        paper that provides an in-depth exploration of our hybrid approach
                        and its implications for image encryption. The paper details the methodology, experimental results, and the significance of our contributions to the field. MATLAB Implementation: We've developed a robust and efficient
                        implementation of our encryption framework using MATLAB. The MATLAB environment allows for rapid prototyping, rigorous
                        testing, and fine-tuning of our algorithms, ensuring optimal
                        performance and security.</p>
